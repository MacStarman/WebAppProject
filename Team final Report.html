<h2>Extras </h2>

<h4> Extras we did:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Giving the customer the ability to  leave a review of the usefulness of their purchased order, like a 5-star rating system.</li>
			<li>  Search back-end feature </li>
			<li>Accessibility report that explains how the app has been changed to be more accessible and follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards. Also how we could improve if we had more time.  </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Reflections on what we have learnt and what we
			would do differently</h2>
		<p> We started the project by dividing the workload and creating an excel spreadsheet so people could decide what task to do. This worked well at the start, however we should have made deadlines for tasks since they are so intertwined with other coding in the application. We also set up a github to share code which was instrumental in seeing how each other was doing and for putting the final project together.
		In reflection we should have split tasks equally for documentaion, as the orginal plan relied on other team members having their assigned sections completed, in order to work on their own agreed part.
		We focused on the backend for the majority of the project which meant we had to put together a template frontend page and linked everyones code to it. We also had to collate three different user controller java files together, whereby we learned that if we did the project in the future we would create a template html page and java controller files first to lessen the work need to bring everyones code together at the end.
